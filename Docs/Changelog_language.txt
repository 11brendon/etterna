StepMania 5 Language Changelog
________________________________________________________________________________
The StepMania 5 Language Changelog covers all language strings added after
StepMania 5.0.6.  This is to inform translators of strings that need to be
translated from English to other languages.
________________________________________________________________________________

Strings are listed by the section of the language file they are in.
One string is listed per line, to minimize confusion.
Example:

* [ScreenDebugOverlay] Mute actions
  Mute actions on
  Mute actions off

This means that three strings were added to the "ScreenDebugOverlay" section,
"Mute actions", "Mute actions on", and "Mute actions off".
