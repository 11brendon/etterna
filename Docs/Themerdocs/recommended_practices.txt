Recommended Practices when theming for sm-ssc
---------------------------------------------
1) Use the --theme= command line parameter to switch between themes quickly.
This way, you don't have to deal with the theme switch and all the possible
nonsense errors that might come up (due to you having a different amount of
song group colors, timer warning states, etc.), and you can quickly switch
themes if you work on many of them at once.
