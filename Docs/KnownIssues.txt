The following is a list of known issues with StepMania 5.

* Hidden, Sudden, Stealth, and RandomVanish do not work with layered
  note skins. Random Vanish, in particular, has caused crashes.
* The course editor is not working completely.
* The scoring system needs to be made global for the game instead
  of tying it to the theme. Right now, this is causing a number
  of themes to have no score display during gameplay.
