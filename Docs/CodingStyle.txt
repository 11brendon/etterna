sm-ssc Code Style Guidelines
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AJ is biased, but prefers to edit text in SciTE and just uses Visual Studio when
necessary. "It's really slow!"

That being said, the sm-ssc code style guidelines are as follows:

1) Follow the current coding conventions set forth in the source code.
This means use tabs. AJ prefers tabs have a width of 4. Visual Studio and web
browsers assume tabs to be 8 by default. :/
Use of the tab character means you can define however the fuck wide you want it
to be.

Use of the space character is allowed for complex alignment. There are many
examples of this in the code.

If it can be done in one line, do so:
int xTwenty(int factor){ return factor*20; }

Otherwise, follow what's in the code, namely...

for single line ifs :
if( somecrap )
	dosomethingelse();

for multi-lines:
if( anothercrap )
{
	omg();
	lotsofstuff();
}

Naming conventions seem to be Hungarian (of Apps or System, I do not know).

2) Remove any unnecessary whitespace. "Unnecessary" whitespace includes tabs
at the end of } characters, tabs that lead nowhere, like this one:
	
and keep in mind that this can be done with spaces too:
    
so watch yourself. Remove 'em all.

3) When making LOG->Trace()s in code, it's best to include the name of the Class
and Function in [], like so:
LOG->Info( "[NetworkSyncManager::Listen] Initializing socket..." );
You may not always need to do this, but it helps for clarity and sanity.

4) There are no other rules (yet).
