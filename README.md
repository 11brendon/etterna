## Installation
### From Packages

For those that do not wish to compile the game on their own and use a binary right away, be aware of the following issues:

* Windows users are expected to have installed the [Microsoft Visual C++ x86 Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145) prior to running the game. For those on a 64-bit operating system, grab the x64 redistributable as well. [DirectX End-User Runtimes (June 2010)](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109) is also required. Windows 7 is the minimum supported version.
* macOS users need to have macOS 10.6.8 or higher to run StepMania.
* Linux users should receive all they need from the package manager of their choice.
