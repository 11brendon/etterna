================================================================================
Introduction [intro]

Welcome to Hello World (and other sm-ssc theming examples).
This theme and accompanying documentation are provided for people new to
theming for StepMania, using sm-ssc as a base.

================================================================================
The Chapters [chapt]

The theme itself is split into three sections, encompassing various elements of
sm-ssc theming.

The Guide is a general run-through of how Themes are constructed (along with
NoteSkins, Announcers, and Characters)
================================================================================
Guide [guide]
This section covers the basics of theming for StepMania.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Metrics and Languages [g_met]

Both the metrics and languages use the .ini format, so they're being lumped
together. If you're not familiar with an .ini file, here's the basics:

# comment
[Section]
Key=Value

This is simple enough for the languages, but the metrics require some more
knowledge to work with.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fonts [g_fon]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Graphics [g_gfx]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BGAnimations [g_bga]

BGAnimations are the heart of any theme. Ever since late 2007, they've been
created using Lua.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sounds [g_sfx]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scripts [g_scr]

Though Lua scripting has been available in StepMania since 2006, the current
iteration is a lot more powerful than before. This is mainly due to the
additional bindings added during sm-ssc (carried over to SM5).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Other [g_oth]

Ever wonder what all those files in the Other folder are for?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NoteSkins [g_not]

jousway is probably gonna have to work on this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Announcers [g_ann]

Announcers are somewhat of a lost art.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Characters [g_cha]

This guide won't teach you how to model or animate, sorry.

================================================================================
Reference [ref]
This section contains a reference of various elements in StepMania.
