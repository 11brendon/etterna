to note, the current Lua bindings have bugs or don't work as intended:

BPMDisplay:GetText() is always one off from the current song.

Steps:GetHash() just plain doesn't work?

CRYPTMAN hash strings use the literal characters instead of the hex displayed as
ASCII. Not a bug, but something to make a note of, lest people get confused.
